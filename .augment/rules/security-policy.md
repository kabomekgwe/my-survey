# Security Policy

## Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets, API keys, credentials, or sensitive information to the repository.
- Use environment variables or secure secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
- Rotate secrets regularly and implement automated secret rotation where possible.
- Use different secrets for different environments (dev, staging, production).
- Implement secret scanning in CI/CD pipelines to detect accidental commits.

## Input Validation and Sanitization
- Validate and sanitize all user-provided input using established libraries (Joi, Yup, Zod).
- Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Implement rate limiting and request size limits to prevent DoS attacks.
- Sanitize HTML content and prevent XSS attacks using libraries like DOMPurify.
- Validate file uploads: check file types, sizes, and scan for malware.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implement proper authentication using JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) with principle of least privilege.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.
- Use secure session management with proper session timeout and invalidation.
- Implement account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts.

## Data Protection
- Do not log personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 or equivalent encryption.
- Use HTTPS for all communications and implement proper TLS configuration.
- Implement data anonymization and pseudonymization for analytics and testing.
- Follow GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable privacy regulations.

## Dependency Security
- Review all third-party dependencies for license compatibility and known vulnerabilities.
- Use automated dependency scanning tools (Snyk, npm audit, GitHub Dependabot).
- Keep dependencies updated and monitor security advisories regularly.
- Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for supply chain security.
- Use dependency pinning and verify package integrity with checksums.

## Security Testing and Monitoring
- Every deployment artifact must be security scanned using Snyk, Trivy, or similar tools.
- Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines (SAST, DAST).
- Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits.
- Monitor for security incidents and implement incident response procedures.
- Use security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) to protect against common attacks.
